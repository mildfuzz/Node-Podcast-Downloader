### Node Podcast Downloader
   - Download podcasts from `subscriptions.json`
   - `mode` can be set to either "latest" or "all"

## TODO

- Improve Feedback
- Abstract Location to CLI variable
- Log Downloads to prevent repition
- Adapt URL mapper to recursively look though entire post object for url
    - Use regex to find strings that start 'http' and end 'mp3'
    - check enclosures first (prioritise standards and reduce workload)
